  			- Update patch to 2.4.21

Sebastian Strollo <sstrollo@nortelnetworks.com>
  			- Fix "Dead-loop on netdevice imq"-issue

Marcel Sebek <sebek64@post.cz>
  			- Update to 2.6.2-rc1

2004/06/30 - New version of IMQ patch to kernels <=2.6.7 including the following changes:

			- Correction of ipv6 support "+"s issue (Hasso Tepper)
			- Correction of imq_init_devs() issue that resulted in kernel OOPS unloading IMQ as module (Norbert Buchmuller)
			- Addition of functionality to choose number of IMQ devices during kernel config (Andre Correa)
			- Addition of functionality to choose how IMQ hooks on PRE and POSTROUTING (after or before NAT) (Andre Correa)
			- Cosmetic corrections (Norbert Buchmuller) (Andre Correa)


2005/12/16 - IMQ versions between 2.6.7 and 2.6.13 were released with almost no problems. 2.6.14-x was released
			 with some important changes: nfcache was removed.
			 After some weeks of trouble we figured out that some IMQ fields in skb were missing in skbuff.c - skb_clone and copy_skb_header.
			 These functions are correctly patched by this new patch version.

			 Thanks for all who helped to figure out all the problems with 2.6.14.x: Patrick McHardy, Rune Kock, VeNoMouS, Max CtRiX,
			 Kevin Shanahan, Richard Lucassen, Valery Dachev (hopefully I didn't forget anybody). I apologize again for my lack of time.


2008/06/17 - 2.6.25 - Changed imq.c to use qdisc_run() instead of qdisc_restart() and moved qdisc_run() to tasklet to avoid
 			recursive locking. New initialization routines to fix 'rmmod' not working anymore. Used code from ifb.c. (Jussi Kivilinna)

2008/08/06 - 2.6.26 - (JK)
		   - Replaced tasklet with 'netif_schedule()'.
		   - Cleaned up and added comments for imq_nf_queue().

2009/04/12
		- Add skb_save_cb/skb_restore_cb helper functions for backuping control buffer. 
		  This is needed because qdisc-layer on kernels 2.6.27 and newer overwrite control buffer. (Jussi Kivilinna)
		- Add better locking for IMQ device. Hopefully this will solve SMP issues. (Jussi Kivilinna)
		- Port to 2.6.27
		- Port to 2.6.28
		- Port to 2.6.29 + fix rmmod not working

2009/04/20  - (Jussi Kivilinna)
			- Use netdevice feature flags to avoid extra packet handling by core networking layer and possibly increase performance.

2009/09/26  - (Jussi Kivilinna)
			- Add imq_nf_reinject_lockless to fix deadlock with imq_nf_queue/imq_nf_reinject.

2009/12/08  - (Jussi Kivilinna)
			- Port to 2.6.32
			- Add check for skb->nf_queue_entry==NULL in imq_dev_xmit()
			- Also add better error checking for skb->nf_queue_entry usage

2010/02/25  - (Jussi Kivilinna)
		    - Port to 2.6.33

2010/08/15  - (Jussi Kivilinna)
			- Port to 2.6.35
			- Simplify hook registration by using nf_register_hooks.
			- nf_reinject doesn't need spinlock around it, therefore remove imq_nf_reinject function. Other nf_reinject users protect
			  their own data with spinlock. With IMQ however all data is needed is stored per skbuff, so no locking is needed.
			- Changed IMQ to use 'separate' NF_IMQ_QUEUE instead of NF_QUEUE, this allows working coexistance of IMQ and other NF_QUEUE users.
			- Make IMQ multi-queue. Number of IMQ device queues can be increased with 'numqueues' module parameters. Default number
			  of queues is 1, in other words by default IMQ works as single-queue device. Multi-queue selection is based on IFB multi-queue patch by Changli Gao <xiaosuo@gmail.com>.

2011/03/18  - (Jussi Kivilinna)
		    - Port to 2.6.38

2011/07/12  - (syoder89@gmail.com)
			- Crash fix that happens when the receiving interface has more than one queue (add missing skb_set_queue_mapping in imq_select_queue).

2011/07/26  - (Jussi Kivilinna)
			- Add queue mapping checks for packets exiting IMQ.
			- Port to 3.0

2011/08/16  - (Jussi Kivilinna)
			- Clear IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING flag that was added for linux 3.0.2

		    - Fix IMQ for net namespaces

2011/11/04  - Jussi Kivilinna <jussi.kivilinna@mbnet.fi>
			- Port to 3.1
			- Clean-up, move 'get imq device pointer by imqX name' to separate function from imq_nf_queue().

            - Port to 3.14
            - Pop and send one packet when push one packet into the IMQ queue.
              It could enhance the IMQ performance about 20%.

Also, many thanks to pablo Sebastian Greco for making the initial patch and to those who helped the testing.
